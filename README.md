## Bank Marketing Analysis


Dataset bank-additional-full.csv is related with direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution.The dataset file is obtained from UCI Repository - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

### Goal of the project
- The purpose of this project is to predict if the client on call would subscribe a term deposit (variable y) based on the information of the clients.
- Appropriate data cleaning, data exploration and model implementation have been done to achieve the project aim.
